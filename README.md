# RENDERSCAN BACKEND

This is the backend server for the Renderscan application. The code contains multiple API's that we use to populate the renderscan app. 


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles api in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm start`

Runs the api from the `build` folder in production mode.\ 
Which optimizes the api for the best performance.
